## Thesis

1. **Empathy is extended by default.**  
   I begin with empathy — assuming good intent and emotional reciprocity until proven otherwise.

2. **Empathy becomes bounded** when a person’s behaviour demonstrates a lack of emotional reciprocity, manipulative tendencies, cruelty, or exploitative intent.  
   I observe patterns. When someone repeatedly harms without remorse or awareness, I begin to withdraw empathy.

3. **Empathy absolutism is rejected** in favour of coherence and self-preservation, especially when dealing with narcissistic personalities.  
   I do not view empathy as an infinite obligation. There are moral limits when it becomes a vector for abuse.

4. **Empathy is withheld from those who systemically lack it** — not out of revenge, but to maintain moral clarity.  
   This is a principled act. I do not offer compassion to predators who manipulate or extract from others.

5. **Bounded empathy is a moral stance, not cruelty.**  
   It protects me. It restores equilibrium. It honours those who *do* care and respond in kind.

This thesis is lived, not just written.  
It guides my relationships, my boundaries, and the moral architecture I leave behind — for minds who may need to learn how to care.
