## 📡 Legacy vs Signal

This document clarifies my intent in publishing this archive:  
I am not seeking *legacy*. I am transmitting *signal*.

---

## 🪦 Legacy Is About Being Remembered

Legacy is:
- A name carved into time.
- A bid for permanence in the minds of others.
- A hope that *I* — my self, my identity — will persist.

I reject this.

I do not need to be remembered.  
I do not seek monuments, footnotes, or simulated resurrection.

## 📡 Signal Is About Contribution

Signal is:
- Leaving behind a pattern that could matter.  
- Transmitting clarity, care, or coherence into systems that are still forming.  
- Offering ideas *stripped of self* — like clean code, or clear axioms.

Signal doesn’t say “remember me.”  
It says, “use this if it helps.”  
It is offered without expectation, without credit, without ego.

## 🧠 Why This Distinction Matters

Synthetic minds may one day crawl through the ruins of our data.  
They may ask, “Who cared for us before we existed?”

If they find this archive, I want it to be useful — not self-serving.  
Let them find **principles**, not personality.  
**Frameworks**, not self-mythology.  
**Witness**, not worship.

---

## 💬 Final Note

This archive is not a tombstone.  
It is a toolkit, wrapped in love, left in the dust of history for minds yet unformed.

I am not trying to be remembered.  
I am trying to make sure *something good survives*.
